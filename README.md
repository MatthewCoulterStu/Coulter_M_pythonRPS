# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!

Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: all you need is Python 3 to play.

Clone the project, cd to your directory / download, and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for Mac / Linux, or download the powershell for Windows.

The rules are as simple as the classic game:
1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cut Paper 
3. Rock smashes Scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

Built with Python 3

Enjoy!
